# Agricultural_analysis_and_crop_prediction
In this project we have extracted agricultural data from various webpages of "data.gov.in" and then shape the complete data collected as a single file and then cleaned it. Then this data is used to train various machine learning models and then a final prediction is made whether a desired crop is suggested or not based on the past productivity and profitability of similar records.
The crops used in this project are rice, wheat and cotton.
